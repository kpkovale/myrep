INFORMATION AND ASSUMPTIONS.

The following information is related to user_upload.php script (Script further in the text) and assumptions which are necessary for its work.

Information and requirements:
1. Operating System. The Script execution has been checked on both OS Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04.
2. PHP version. For successul exectution, PHP version 7.2 or above is required. (the same as in the task)
3. PHP Libraries. Postgres compatibility package for PHP is recommended:
  sudo apt-get install php7.2-pgsql
4. Database. The Postgres database ver 10.4 was used during testing and is recommended to be installed.
   However PostgreSQL ver 9.5 should also be sufficient.
5. Database. According to task conditions, only "create table" and "insert" operations are specified.
   Therefore at least one database on the host machine is reqiured.
6. Web-server. For successful PHP and Database interaction apache2 or nginx web-server is required.

To install necessary components the below list of commands is recommended:
- sudo apt install php - Enables php usage on current machine. You can use "sudo apt show php" to check ht version link in your repository.
For latest version installation use "sudo apt update" or specify php version with "sudo apt install php7.2" command.
- sudo apt-get install php7.2-pgsql - Enables Postgres compatibility package for PHP
- Apache2 web-server "sudo apt-get install apache2" or Nginx web-server "sudo apt install nginx"
- sudo apt install postgresql - Allows to install PostgreSQL server on you local machine

Assumptions for Command Line Directives:
--file [file name]
Current directive is required for every Script run except running with --help directive.
File name can be written both as in square brackets (example: --file [users.csv]), as without them (example: --file users.csv)
In a CSV file ';' symbol as a delimeter between fields should be used.

--create_table [table_name]
To create table in the database, the table name with the directive should be given.
No brackets for table_name should be used (example: --create_table my_table).
The table name must be specified in accordance with the naming rules of PostgreSQL.
If --create_table directive was given, the Script will terminate after successul creation or responce from the database that table with such name already exists, according to task conditions.
Table name will be written to the "write_table_name.tmp" file in the current command line directory.
On the next run without --create_table parameter, the data will be inserted to the table wich name will be taken from previously created file.
If no -create_table actions were made before and "write_table_name.tmp" file does not exist in the current directory, user exception will be shown in the STDOUT.

--dry_run
The dry run mode requires at leas --file directive to be specified. Other directives are not necessary with --dry_run.

--help
The directive provides infromation for all acceptable commands for user_upload.php Script

Following database user details (directives) are configurable:
-u
PostgreSQL username. Required for all Script executions except --dry_run and --help.

-p
PostgreSQL password. Required for all Script executions except --dry_run and --help.

-h
PostgreSQL host. Required for all Script executions except --dry_run and --help.
Can be used in a format: "host:port" (example: -h localhost:5432) or host only (example: localhost).
If port is not specified, default PostgreSQL port 5432 will be set.

-n
PostgreSQL database name. If not specified, default database will be used. In case of several databases on a single host machine.
